Creating Beauty in Our Inner and Outer Lives
            </p>
            <p>

Creative expression through photography can bring joy, connection and new perspectives into our lives. As we are faced with the challenges of systems and a planet under threat, the urgency of appreciating, connecting with, and sharing the natural world and deepening our inner lives and those of our communities is of profound importance.
The Integral Eye provides the opportunity to deepen our connection to the natural world, to evolve our spiritual lives and to learn photography in an integrally informed process. We will use photography as a means for investigating our inner and outer lives, not only personally but also in community.
Through photography, discussion, meditation and movement, we will explore meaning, creativity, spirituality and what it means to connect $(Cwi(Bth the more than human world.$(D P(Bhotographic techniques including composition and depth of field will be discussed, as well as awareness and perception. We will also have the opportunity to have our work examined with useful feedback provided.
